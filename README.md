## Claude Code Implementation Demo with Rig
This demo showcases a basic implementation of Claude Code with Rig.

## How to run
Before running, you will need the Rust programming language installed and an Anthropic API key. You can either add this as an environment variable upon using `cargo run` (ie, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=foo cargo run`) or have it saved elsewhere as an environment variable. It is suggested that you use `direnv` if you are developing locally.

Once you have both, then you can simply use `cargo run`!
